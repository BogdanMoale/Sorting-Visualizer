# Sorting-Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application that provides an interactive way to visualize and understand various sorting algorithms. This project allows users to dynamically generate an array of elements and visualize the step-by-step sorting process, providing a visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work and their efficiency.

# Features

* Interactive Visualization: Users can observe the sorting process in real-time, as the algorithm rearranges the elements of the array, with bars representing the elements.

* Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The Sorting Visualizer supports several sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Shell Sort, and Heap Sort.

* Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at different rates, helping to understand the algorithm's behavior and efficiency

# Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The core technologies for building the user interface and implementing the sorting algorithms.

# How to Use

1. Open the Sorting Visualizer in a web browser : https://bogdanmoale.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/
2. Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new array of elements.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.
4. Adjust the speed slider to control the visualization speed.
5. Click the "Sort" button to start the sorting process.
6. Watch the bars representing the elements move and rearrange as the sorting algorithm progresses.

# Why Use This Project?

* Learning Tool: The Sorting Visualizer is an educational tool that helps users understand the inner workings of different sorting algorithms through visualization.

* Comparison: Users can compare the performance and efficiency of various sorting algorithms, helping them make informed decisions when choosing an algorithm for specific scenarios.

* Engaging Demonstration: This project provides an engaging and interactive way to demonstrate complex sorting algorithms, making it an ideal resource for teaching and learning.

# Future Enhancements

* Adding more sorting algorithms to expand the learning experience.
* Implementing additional customization options for users, such as array size and colors.
* Providing explanations and analysis of each sorting algorithm's time complexity and best-use cases.
